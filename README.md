# Medihelp-Online-Healthcare-Centre

A Virtual Medicare Service that connects patients and doctors in an online platform, letting them to consult at the comfort of their home, thereby creating a safe and a reliable virtual atmosphere.
Moreover, letting the patient to view the qualifications, specialisations and ratings of a particular doctor would create a sense of high reliability and satisfaction within the scope of the patient.
The patients can also share their feedback about their consultation with their doctor via email. Yet another problem which the patients face is that, the patient might not know the root cause of certain illness and not being sure of what specialisation should he/she seek to solve the problem.
This is solved by an ML model which could predict the disease which the patient is most probable to have based upon the symptoms exhibited.
